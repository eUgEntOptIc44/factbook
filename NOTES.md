## Country Comparison Pages

Country Comparison pages are presorted lists of data from selected Factbook data fields.
Country Comparison pages are generally given in descending order - highest to lowest - such as Population and Area.
The two exceptions are Unemployment Rate and Inflation Rate, which are in ascending - lowest to highest - order.

Country Comparison pages are available for the following 79 fields in seven of the ten Factbook categories.
